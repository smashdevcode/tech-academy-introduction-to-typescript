 * What are some of the things that you like about JavaScript?
 * What are some of the things that you don't like about C#?
 * What are some of the things that you don't like about JavaScript?

## Static vs Dynamic Typing

* Does JavaScript have a type system?
* What is the difference between static and dynamic typing?

"Dynamically typed languages are generally interpreted, thus type checking (if any) happens at run time when they are used. A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed to run-time. In static typing, types are associated with variables not values." - Wikipedia

## What is TypeScript?

* Superset of JavaScript that compiles down to idiomatic JavaScript
* TypeScript adds optional static typing to JavaScript
 * This removes ambiguity from code by allowing developers to be explicit with type information
 * This greatly improves the JavaScript development environment
* Because TypeScript compiles down to JS, you can leverage JS features that aren't widely supported
* Open source project on GitHub
