## What is JavaScript?

* Who has done JavaScript development?
* Who has done TypeScript development?
 * Who's used VS Code to do JS development?
 * VS Code leverages TypeScript to make JS dev a great experience
* Programming language of the web
 * Runs just about anywhere
 * Browser
 * Node.js
* JavaScript is an interpreted language
 * JavaScript isn't compiled
 * Instead it's evaluated and executed at runtime

## C# vs JavaScript

* Who has done C#/.NET development?
* If you compare C# and JavaScript...
 * What are some of the things that you like about C#?
 * What are some of the things that you like about JavaScript?
 * What are some of the things that you don't like about C#?
 * What are some of the things that you don't like about JavaScript?

## Static vs Dynamic Typing

* Does JavaScript have a type system?
* What is the difference between static and dynamic typing?

"Dynamically typed languages are generally interpreted, thus type checking (if any) happens at run time when they are used. A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed to run-time. In static typing, types are associated with variables not values." - Wikipedia

## Demo - JavaScript

* Type system
 * Primitive types
  * Boolean
  * Null
  * Undefined
  * Number
  * String
  * Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)
 * Object
 * Standard Objects
  * Date
  * Array
 * Dynamic typing
* Control structures
* Classes
* Function level scoping

## What is TypeScript?

* Superset of JavaScript that compiles down to idiomatic JavaScript
* TypeScript adds optional static typing to JavaScript
 * This removes ambiguity from code by allowing developers to be explicit with type information
 * This greatly improves the JavaScript development environment
* Because TypeScript compiles down to JS, you can leverage JS features that aren't widely supported
* Open source project on GitHub

## Demo - Kicking the Tires

* Install TypeScript
* Create a TypeScript file
* Compile the TypeScript file

## Demo - Language Overview

## Other Demos

* Hybrid Project
* Strict Null Checking
* Async/Await
* Angular 2 (decorators)
* React (JSX support)
